checksum of the delivered NPX file.}
\usage{
check_checksum(checksum_file, npx_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{checksum_file}{The plain file that contains the checksum output from
Olink software. The file should contain "MD5" or "SHA256" in the file name.}

\item{npx_file}{The NPX file accompanying the checksum file.}
}
\value{
A string or NA. If the function return NA then everything worked
fine, otherwise there was some sort of error.

We should make it here only if MD5_checksum.txt or checksum_sha256.txt are
present in the zip file.

This function does not check whether checksum_file is in acceptable format.
