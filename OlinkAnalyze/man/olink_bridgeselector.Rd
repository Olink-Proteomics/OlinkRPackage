\usage{
olink_bridgeselector(df, sampleMissingFreq, n, warning_string = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Tibble/data frame in long format such as produced by the olinkr read_NPX function.}

\item{sampleMissingFreq}{The threshold for sample wise missingness.}

\item{n}{Number of bridge samples to be selected.}

\item{warning_string}{The string used to indicate that a sample received a QC warning. Most common, it is either "WARN" or "Warning". If this is not given, the function tries to detect it from the given data frame.}
}
\value{
Tibble with sample ID:s and mean NPX for a defined number of bridging samples.
}
\description{
The bridge selection function will select a number of bridge samples based on the input data. It select samples with
good detection, which passes QC and cover a good range of the data. If possible olink recommends 8-16 bridge samples.
Bridge sample selection strategy: Output 2x (number of bridging samples) for final selection (by customer).
When running the selector, start at 10\% missingness. If there are not enough samples output, increase to 20\%.
If still not enough, consider outputting e.g. 1.5x (number of bridging samples) for final selection. \cr\cr
The function accepts NPX Excel files with data < LOD replaced.
