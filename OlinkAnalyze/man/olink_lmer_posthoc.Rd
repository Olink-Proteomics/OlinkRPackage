\title{Function which performs a linear mixed model posthoc per protein.}
\usage{
olink_lmer_posthoc(
  df,
  variable,
  olinkid_list = NULL,
  effect,
  outcome = "NPX",
  random,
  covariates = NULL,
  mean_return = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{NPX data frame in long format with at least protein name (Assay), OlinkID, UniProt, 1-2 variables with at least 2 levels and subject ID.}

\item{variable}{Single character value or character array.
Variable(s) to test. If length > 1, the included variable names will be used in crossed analyses .
Also takes ':' or '*' notation.}

\item{olinkid_list}{Character vector of OlinkID's on which to perform post hoc analysis. If not specified, all assays in df are used.}

\item{effect}{Term on which to perform post-hoc. Character vector. Must be subset of or identical to variable.}

\item{outcome}{Character. The dependent variable. Default: NPX.}

\item{random}{Single character value or character array.}

\item{covariates}{Single character value or character array. Default: NULL.
Covariates to include. Takes ':' or '*' notation. Crossed analysis will not be inferred from main effects.}

\item{mean_return}{Boolean. If true, returns the mean of each factor level rather than the difference in means (default). Note that no p-value is returned for mean_return = TRUE and no adjustment is performed.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean. Default: True. If information about removed samples, factor conversion and final model formula is to be printed to the console.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the results of the pairwise comparisons between given variable levels for proteins specified in olinkid_list (or full df).
}
\description{
Similar to olink_lmer but performs a post hoc analysis based on a linear mixed model effects model using lmerTest::lmer and emmeans::emmeans on proteins.
See \code{olink_lmer} for details of input notation. \cr\cr
The function handles both factor and numerical variables and/or covariates.
Differences in estimated marginal means are calculated for all pairwise levels of a given variable.
Degrees of freedom are estimated using Satterthwaiteâ€™s approximation.
The posthoc test for a numerical variable compares the difference in means of the outcome variable (default: NPX) for 1 standard deviation difference in the numerical variable, e.g.
mean NPX at mean(numerical variable) versus mean NPX at mean(numerical variable) + 1*SD(numerical variable).
The output tibble is arranged by ascending Tukey adjusted p-values.
