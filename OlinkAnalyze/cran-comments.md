## Release Summary

This release provides additional functionality and documentation to Olink Analyze 3.9. It also optimizes and improves reproducibility for olink_normalization() and educational materials for the new functionality.

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs on Windows and Linux systems. There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs on MacOS. 1 NOTE was found on MacOS:
  installed size is  5.2Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    doc   2.6Mb
The increased doc size is due to figures in vignettes having increased storage on MacOS. Efforts were made to decrease image size and quality while still retaining key functionality for package users. Package size was found to be below 5 Mb on both Windows and Linux systems and doc sub-directory did not flag on checks on these systems.
