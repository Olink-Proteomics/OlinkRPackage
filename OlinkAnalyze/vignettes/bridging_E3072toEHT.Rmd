## Introduction

Individual Olink® NPX^TM^ datasets are normalized using either plate
control normalization or intensity normalization methods. In the case
when a study is separated into multiple batches, an additional
normalization step is needed to allow the data to be comparable, since
NPX is a relative measurement. The following tutorial is designed to
give you an overview of the Olink® bridging procedure for combining
datasets from Explore 3072 and Explore HT products.

### Within- and between-product bridging

The joint analysis of two or more Olink® NPX datasets run on the same
Olink® product often requires an additional batch correction step to
remove technical variation, which is referred to as overlapping sample
reference normalization, bridge normalization, or just simply bridging.
For more information on within-product bridging, see the [Introduction
to Bridging
tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OlinkAnalyze/vignettes/bridging_introduction.html).

Explore 3072 and Explore HT are both Olink® platforms that use PEA
technology combined with next generation sequencing to calculate NPX for
thousands of proteins. Since many of the assays profiled in Explore 3072
are also found on Explore HT, bridging data across products enables
increased power in studies consisting of both 3072 and HT datasets,
rather than limiting these studies to meta-analysis. However, these
products differ in the number of assays measured and in the **antibodies
and reagents used**, which means that normalization cannot be performed
in the same way that within-product bridging is performed.

In the case where a study consists of separate batches run in both the
Olink® Explore 3072 and the Explore HT platforms, an additional batch
correction step is required to allow data from these two platforms to be
analyzed together, which is referred to as **product bridging, or
Explore 3072 to HT bridging**.

### Considerations for product bridging

Product bridging allows the NPX values of an Olink® Explore 3072 project
to be normalized and made comparable to the NPX values of an Olink®
Explore HT project. This process is one-directional, and normalizing
Explore HT NPX values to Explore 3072 is not supported.

The product bridging normalization uses the **\~3000** assays that are
overlapping between Explore 3072 and HT. Each overlapping assay
undergoes a series of checks that evaluate the number of counts,
correlation, and difference of NPX ranges between the two datasets. If
an assay has enough counts and comparable metrics between the two
datasets, it is determined to be suitable for bridging (referred to as a
"bridgeable assay"). The set of "bridgable assays" across platforms will
vary from dataset to dataset, based on the samples present within the
studies. Depending on the NPX distribution of each bridgeable assay in
the two datasets, the assay is normalized using either median
normalization or **QQ normalization**.

Product bridging between an Explore 3072 and an Explore HT NPX dataset
requires **40-60 bridging samples**. Bridging samples are shared samples
among datasets - that is that samples that are analyzed in both
datasets. Olink® NPX datasets without shared samples should not be
combined using the bridging approach described below. Before starting
bridging, it is important to check if the same sample IDs were assigned
to the bridging samples. More information on bridge sample selection can
be found in the [selecting bridging samples
section](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OlinkAnalyze/vignettes/bridging_introduction.html#selecting-bridging-samples)
of the Introduction to Bridging tutorial.

## Bridge Sample Selection

Prior to running the second study, bridging samples must be selected
from the Explore 3072 study and be added to the Explore HT study. These
samples can be selected using the `olink_bridgeselector()` function in
Olink Analyze. The bridge selection function will select a number of
bridge samples based on the reference data. This function selects
samples which passes QC. External controls are not selected as bridge
samples as they are not necessarily representative of the study and
therefore may not cover the dynamic range of assays that would be
expressed within the samples. Note that due to naming convention
differences, it is necessary to exclude the control samples using either
`SampleType == "SAMPLE"` if available or `stringr::str_detect()` as
shown below.

To select samples across the range of the data, the samples are ordered
by mean NPX value and selected across this range. In the case where LOD
data is available, Olink recommends starting at
`sampleMissingFreq = 0.10` which represents a maximum of 10% data below
LOD per sample. If there are not enough samples output, increase to 20%.
For alternative matrices and specific disease types, it may be needed to
increase the sampleMissingFreq to higher levels. For cases where LOD
data is not available, `sampleMissingFreq` can be set to 1.

In the example below we demonstrate how to select **45** bridging
samples using `npx_data1` which will act as the Explore 3072 data. The
selected bridge samples are displayed in Table 2.

```{r bridge_sample_selection_example}

bridge_Samples<- npx_data1 %>% 
  # Excluding control samples. Naming convention may differ.
  dplyr::filter((stringr::str_detect(SampleID, "CONTROL", negate = TRUE))) %>%
  olink_bridgeselector(sampleMissingFreq = 0.1,
                     n = 16)
```

```{r bridge_sample_selection}
npx_data1 %>% 
  filter((stringr::str_detect(SampleID, "CONTROL", negate = TRUE))) %>%
  olink_bridgeselector(sampleMissingFreq = 0.1,
                     n = 16) %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(booktabs = TRUE,
      digits = 2,
      caption = "Table 2. Selected Bridging Samples") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE,
                position = "center", latex_options = "HOLD_position")
  
```

It's important to make sure that the select bridge samples are
representative of the overall samples within the study. This can be done
by generating a PCA plot with the following code and make sure that the
bridge samples are evenly dispersed among the other samples, as shown in
Figure 1.

```{r bridge_sample_selection_example_pca, fig.cap= f1}
npx_data1 %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(SampleID, 'CONT')) %>%
  mutate(Bridge = ifelse(SampleID %in% bridge_Samples$SampleID, "Bridge", "Sample")) %>% 
  olink_pca_plot(color_g = "Bridge")
f1<- "Figure 1. PCA plot of bridging samples and other samples in npx_data1. Control samples are excluded from the PCA plot."

```

## Workflow Overview

Olink Explore 3072 to Olink Explore HT bridging required harmonized
Explore 3072 data and Explore HT data which has at least **XX**
overlapping bridge samples. For studies containing multiple batches of
Explore 3072 data, the Explore 3072 data sets should be bridged using
within product bridging as detailed in the Introduction to bridging
tutorial prior to performing between product bridging.

The assays from Explore 3072 are matched to the corresponding assays in
Explore HT and evaluated to determine if the assay is bridgeable. In
parallel the assay is normalized using **quantile-quantile
normalization** and normalization using the median of paired
differences. The result is an adjusted Explore 3072 dataset with three
additional columns:

-   a flag which indicates if the assay is bridgeable and, if so, which
    normalization method is recommended

-   NPX values for normalization using the median of paired differences

-   NPX values using **quantile-quantile normalization**

A visual representation of the workflow is shown below.

```{r, fig.cap= fcap, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("../man/figures/Bridging_schematic.png"), error = FALSE)
fcap <- "Schematic of Explore 3072 to Explore HT Bridging Workflow"
```

Note that regardless of the bridging recommendation, NPX values will be
available for both normalization methods.

## Import NPX files

To normalize Explore 3072 data to Explore HT data, first the two
datasets are read into R using `read_NPX()`. If more that two data sets
are being normalized, all Explore 3072 studies should be normalized
together prior to normalizing between products. One Explore HT study
should be chosen as the reference data set. The bridge samples should
have the same Sample IDs in both platforms. The input data sets are
standard Olink NPX tables. They can be loaded using `read_NPX()`
function with default Olink Software NPX file as input, as shown below.

```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
data_E3072 <- read_NPX("~/NPX_Explore3072_location.parquet") # Could also be a CSV file
data_EHT <- read_NPX("~/NPX_ExploreHT_location.parquet")
```

## Checking input datasets and bridging samples

First, confirm that there are overlapping sample IDs within the study.
It is important that the sample IDs are the same in both NPX files as
shown in Table 3. Note that while external controls may share the same
SampleID in both datasets, theses samples should not be treated as
bridging samples. External control samples often share the same naming
convention across datasets but may represent different samples due to
reagent batch differences. Additionally, external control samples are
unlikely to cover the dynamic range of assays expressed in the study
samples.

```{r, eval= FALSE}
data.frame(SampleID = intersect(npx_data1$SampleID, npx_data2$SampleID)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!stringr::str_detect(SampleID, "CONTROL_SAMPLE"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

data.frame(SampleID = intersect(npx_data1$SampleID, npx_data2$SampleID)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!stringr::str_detect(SampleID, "CONTROL_SAMPLE")) %>% #Remove control samples
  kableExtra::kbl(booktabs = TRUE,
      digits = 2,
      caption = "Table 3. Overlapping Bridge Samples") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE,
                position = "center", latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

Use a PCA plot as shown in Figure 3 to visualize sample-to-sample
distance before bridging. Typically the project dataset accounts for
most of the observed variation within the combined datasets at this
point. Control samples are removed from the PCA plot because they are
not expected to be representative of the rest of the dataset, and
therefore the variation between sample and control samples could skew
the PCA, making it more challenging to see differences between projects.
Additional, the PCA function does not support multiple samples with the
same SampleID, which is also why the bridging samples in the second
project are appended with "\_new". In Figure 3, data1 and data2 separate
along PC1, indicating batch differences between the two datasets.

```{r pca1, message=FALSE, fig.cap=f3}
#### Extract bridging samples

overlapping_samples <-  data.frame(SampleID = intersect(npx_1$SampleID, npx_2$SampleID)) %>%  
  filter(!str_detect(SampleID, "CONTROL_SAMPLE")) %>% #Remove control samples
  pull(SampleID)

npx_before_br <- npx_data1 %>%
  dplyr::filter(!str_detect(SampleID, "CONTROL_SAMPLE")) %>% #Remove control samples
  dplyr::mutate(Type = if_else(SampleID %in% overlapping_samples,
                        paste0("data1 Bridge"),
                        paste0("data1 Sample"))) %>%
  rbind({
    npx_data2 %>%
      filter(!str_detect(SampleID, "CONTROL_SAMPLE")) %>% #Remove control samples %>% 
      mutate(Type = if_else(SampleID %in% overlapping_samples,
                            paste0("data2 Bridge"),
                            paste0("data2 Sample"))) %>%
      mutate(SampleID = if_else(SampleID %in% overlapping_samples,
                                paste0(SampleID, "_new"),
                                SampleID))
  })

### PCA plot
OlinkAnalyze::olink_pca_plot(df          = npx_before_br,
                             color_g     = "Type",
                             byPanel     = TRUE)
```

## Normalization

We can use `olink_normalization_bridge_product()` function to bridge two
datasets. The bridging procedure is to first calculate **the median of
the paired NPX differences** per assay between the bridging samples as
adjustment factor then use these adjustment factors to adjust NPX values
between two datasets. In this process, one dataset is considered the
reference dataset (`df1`) and its NPX values remain unaltered. The other
dataset is considered the new dataset (`df2`) and is adjusted to the
reference dataset based on the adjustment factors.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Find shared samples
npx_1 <- npx_data1 %>%
  mutate(Project = "data1") 
npx_2 <- npx_data2 %>%
  mutate(Project = "data2")

overlap_samples <-data.frame(SampleID = intersect(npx_1$SampleID, npx_2$SampleID)) %>%
  filter(!str_detect(SampleID, "CONTROL_SAMPLE")) %>% #Remove control samples
  pull(SampleID)

overlap_samples_list <- list("DF1" = overlap_samples,
                             "DF2" = overlap_samples)
olink_normalization_bridge_product(exploreht_df, 
                                   explore3072_df,
                                   bridge_samples,
                                   exploreht_name = "reference",
                                   explore3072_name = "new")
```

### Determining bridging recommendations

There are four criteria that are used to determine if an assay is
bridgeable and what normalization method should be used:

-   Is there a linear relationship between products?
-   Are the NPX ranges in the two products similar?
-   Are there sufficient counts in the Explore HT data?
-   Are the distributions between products the same shape?

An overview of these criteria is visualized below.

```{r, fig.cap= fcap, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("../man/figures/assay_bridgeability.png"), error = FALSE)
fcap <- "Criteria to determine the bridging recommendation for an assay"
```

Prior to assessment, outlier bridge samples are excluded. A sample is
considered an outlier if the NPX value is more than 3 times the
interquartile range above or below the median on either platform.

After assessment, an assay is considered bridgeable if it meets the
first three criteria. The fourth criteria determines which normalization
method is recommended for bridging. If all four criteria are met than
the recommended method is normalization using the median of paired
differences. If only the first three criteria are met then
quantile-quantile normalization is recommended. If any of the first
three criteria are not met than bridging is not recommended for that
assay. Note that bridgeable assays will differ between projects based on
the expression of bridge samples in the studies.

#### Assessing linearity across products

To determine if there is a linear relationship between products for an
assay, the linear coefficient of determination is calculated using
Pearson correlation. In this correlation counts below 10 are excluded
due to lack of signal. The R^2^ value is calculated and an assay is
considered to have a linear relationship across products if the R^2^
value is above the cutoff. The default cutoff is set to R^2^ \> 0.8.

#### Assessing similarity of NPX ranges

To determine if the NPX ranges are similar across products, the
difference in NPX values from the 10% to 90% quantile is calculated for
each platform, excluding data points with counts less than 10. If the
difference in range between platforms is greater than the cutoff than
the ranges are not considered similar across platforms. By default, the
cutoff is set to a difference of less than 1 NPX between platforms.

#### Assessing if there are sufficient counts.

To determine if there are sufficient counts in an assay for bridging,
the median number of counts from Explore HT is calculated, excluding
counts less than 10. If the median number of counts is less than the
cutoff than the assay does not have sufficient counts to be used for
bridging. The default cutoff is set to 150 counts.

#### Assessing similarity of NPX distribution across products

If the three criteria outlined above are met than the assay is
considered bridgeable. Otherwise, bridging is not recommended for that
assay. If an assay is bridgeable, the similarity of the NPX distribution
is used to determine which method is recommended for bridging. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, or KS test, is used to assess the similarity of
two distributions by calculating the distances between the NPX
distributions for each product. If the distance is above the cutoff than
quantile-quantile normalization is recommended. If the distance is less
than the cutoff than normalization using the median of paired
differences is recommended. By default this cutoff difference is set to
0.2.

### Normalization using the median of paired differences

If it is expected that both the kind of distribution and the equal
variance per test between runs are the same, then the normalization
using the median of paired differences will be preferred. The
normalization using the median of paired differences based on the bridge
samples is performed in the following steps:

1.  For each assay and the Explore 3072 project, calculate the pairwise
    difference for each of the overlapping samples with the Explore HT
    project.

2.  Estimate the normalization factor of each assay by finding the
    median of the pairwise differences.

3.  Use the assay-specific normalization factor for each assay to
    normalize each data point from Explore 3072 to Explore HT.

### Quantile-Quantile normalization

Since Explore HT and Explore 3072 are two distinct products and the
assays differ considerably between products, some of the assays exist in
corresponding but distinct NPX spaces. For those assays, a
Quantile-Quantile normalization will be favored. The normalization using
the Quantile-Quantile Normalization based on the bridge samples is
performed in the following steps:

1.  For each assay of Explore 3072, calculate the empirical distribution
    function.

2.  Map the empirical distribution function from Explore 3072 to the
    Explore HT space using the quantiles.

3.  Construct a spline regression model using the sorted Explore 3072
    data and the mapped Explore 3072 data along with the anchor points
    of the spline function.

4.  Use the spline regression model to predict all the data points from
    Explore 3072 to Explore HT.

### Function Output

The output from `olink_normalization_bridge()` function is a NPX table
with adjusted NPX value in the column `NPX`, as shown in Table 4.
`olink_normalization_bridge()` creates a new column `Project` to
distinguish between reference dataset from the other dataset. It is up
to the user to define which dataset is the reference dataset and specify
the names of the bridge samples. The resulting dataset will contain the
reference dataset, which will be identical to the input reference data,
with adjustment factors of 0, and the newly bridged dataset.

```{r norm_data_table , echo = FALSE}
npx_br_data %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(booktabs = TRUE,
      digits = 1,
      caption = "Table 4. First 10 rows of combined datasets after bridging.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE, font_size = 10, 
                position = "center", latex_options = "HOLD_position") %>% 
  kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

## Evaluating the quality of bridging

use PCA plot to check whether bridging normalization has effect in
correcting batch effects (Figure 8). In the example below, it is clear
that before bridging samples from data 1 and 2 are divided into separate
clusters due to the batch effects (Figure 3), but after bridging they
are shown as one cluster in the PCA plot (Figure 8). Bridging
normalization has sufficiently removed the batch effects between two
data sets.

```{r pca2, message=FALSE, fig.cap= f8}
## After bridging

### Generate unique SampleIDs

npx_after_br <- npx_br_data %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Type = ifelse(SampleID %in% overlapping_samples, 
                              paste(Project, "Bridge"),
                              paste(Project, "Sample"))) %>%
  dplyr:::mutate(SampleID = paste0(Project, PlateID, SampleID))

### PCA plot
OlinkAnalyze::olink_pca_plot(df          = npx_after_br,
                             color_g     = "Type",
                             byPanel     = TRUE)
```

## Exporting Normalized Data

The normalized Explore 3072 data can be exported using
`arrow::write_parquet()` to create a long format Olink Explore file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df <- normalized_data |>
    dplyr::filter(Project == "Explore_3072_NAME") |>
    arrow::as_arrow_table()

df$metadata$FileVersion <- "NA"
df$metadata$ExploreVersion <- "NA"
df$metadata$ProjectName <- "NA"
df$metadata$SampleMatrix <- "NA"
df$metadata$DataFileType <- "Olink Analyze Export File"
df$metadata$ProductType <- "Explore3072"
df$metadata$Product <- "Explore3072"
arrow::write_parquet(x = df, sink = "path_to_output.parquet")
```

## FAQs

### Correlation Assays

Both the Explore 3072 and Explore HT platforms contain correlation
assays in their biomarker portfolios. In Explore 3072, these present as
overlapping assays across panels. In Explore HT, these are overlapping
assays across blocks. The correlation assays are included for QC
purposes and allow users to evaluate data performance across panels in
Explore 3072 and across blocks in Explore HT.

Within each platform, the correlation assays contain unique OlinkID
values for each of their corresponding panels and blocks in Explore 3072
and Explore HT, respectively. It should be noted that the correlation
assays themselves differ between each platform. For more information on
overlapping assays, you can access the [Olink FAQ
page](https://olink.com/knowledge/faq).

Explore 3072 to Explore HT bridging generates and returns adjusted
values for all data points corresponding to each of the Explore 3072
correlation assays. In other words, each instance of an overlapping
assay will contain an adjusted value in its respective Explore 3072
panel *For consistency in reference values, only the Block 5 data points
from Explore HT's correlation assays are used in the Explore 3072 to
Explore HT bridging process. For downstream analysis, it is recommended
to include the data from all instances of the correlation assays,
barring any clear outliers.*
