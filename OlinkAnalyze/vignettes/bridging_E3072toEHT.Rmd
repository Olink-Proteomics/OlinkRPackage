## Introduction

Individual Olink® NPX datasets are normalized using either plate control
normalization or intensity normalization methods. In the case when a study is 
separated into multiple batches, an additional normalization step is needed to 
allow the data to be comparable, since NPX is a relative measurement. The 
following tutorial is designed to give you an overview of the Olink® bridging 
procedure for combining datasets from Explore 3072 and Explore HT products.

### Within- and between-product bridging

The joint analysis of two or more Olink® NPX datasets run on the same Olink® 
product often requires an additional batch correction step to
remove technical variation, which is referred to as overlapping sample 
reference normalization, bridge normalization, or just simply bridging. For more
information on within-product bridging, see the [Introduction to Bridging 
tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OlinkAnalyze/vignettes/bridging_introduction.html).


Explore 3072 and Explore HT are both Olink® platforms that use PEA technology
combined with next generation sequencing to calculate NPX for thousands of 
proteins. Since many of the assays profiled in Explore 3072 are also found on 
Explore HT, bridging data across products enables increased power in studies 
consisting of both 3072 and HT datasets, rather than limiting these studies to 
meta-analysis. However, these products differ in the number of assays measured 
and in the **antibodies and reagents used**, which means that normalization 
cannot be performed in the same way that within-product bridging is performed.

In the case where a study consists of separate batches run in both the Olink® 
Explore 3072 and the Explore HT platforms, an additional batch correction
step is required to allow data from these two platforms to be analyzed together, 
which is referred to as **product bridging, or Explore 3072 to HT bridging**.

### Considerations for product bridging

Product bridging allows the NPX values of an Olink® Explore 3072 project to be 
normalized and made comparable to the NPX values of an Olink® Explore HT project. This
process is one-directional, and normalizing Explore HT NPX values to Explore 
3072 is not supported. 

The product bridging normalization uses the **~3000** assays that are
overlapping between Explore 3072 and HT. Each overlapping assay undergoes 
a series of checks that evaluate the number of counts, correlation, and 
difference of NPX ranges between the two datasets. If an assay has enough counts
and comparable metrics between the two datasets, it is determined to be suitable
for bridging (referred to as a "bridgeable assay"). The set of "bridgable 
assays" across platforms will vary from dataset to dataset, based on the samples
present within the studies. Depending on the NPX distribution of each bridgeable
assay in the two datasets, the assay is normalized using either median 
normalization or **QQ normalization**.

Product bridging between an Explore 3072 and an Explore HT NPX dataset
requires **40-60 bridging samples**. Bridging samples are shared samples among
datasets - that is that samples that are analyzed in both datasets. Olink® NPX
datasets without shared samples should not be combined using the bridging 
approach described below. Before starting bridging, it is important to check if 
the same sample IDs were assigned to the bridging samples. More information on 
bridge sample selection can be found in the [selecting bridging samples section](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OlinkAnalyze/vignettes/bridging_introduction.html#selecting-bridging-samples)
of the Introduction to Bridging tutorial.

## Bridge Sample Selection

## Workflow Overview

Olink Explore 3072 to Olink Explore HT bridging required harmonized
Explore 3072 data and Explore HT data which has at least XX overlapping
bridge samples. The assays from Explore 3072 are matched to the
corresponding assays in Explore HT and evaluated to determine if the
assay is bridgeable. In parallel the assay is normalized using
quantile-quantile normalization and normalization using the median of
paired differences. The result is an adjusted Explore 3072 dataset with
three additional columns:

-   a flag which indicates if the assay is bridgeable and, if so, which
    normalization method performs better

-   NPX values for normalization using the median of paired differences

-   NPX values using quantile-quantile normalization

A visual representation of the workflow is shown below.

```{r, fig.cap= fcap, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("../man/figures/Bridging_schematic.png"), error = FALSE)
fcap <- "Schematic of Explore 3072 to Explore HT Bridging Workflow"
```


Note that regardless of the bridging recommendation, NPX values will be
available for both normalization methods.

## Import NPX files

To normalize Explore 3072 data to Explore HT data, first the two
datasets are read into R using `read_NPX()`. If more that two datasets
are being normalized, all Explore 3072 studies should be normalized
together prior to normalizing between products. One Explore HT study
should be chosen as the reference dataset. The bridge samples should
have the same Sample IDs in both platforms. The input datasets are
standard Olink^®^ NPX^TM^ tables. They can be loaded using `read_NPX()`
function with default Olink Software NPX file as input, as shown below.

```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
data_E3072 <- read_NPX("~/NPX_Explore3072_location.parquet") # Could also be a CSV file
data_EHT <- read_NPX("~/NPX_ExploreHT_location.parquet")
```

## Checking input datasets and bridging samples

## Normalization

### Determining bridging recommendations

There are four criteria that are used to determine if an assay is
bridgeable and what normalization method should be used:

-   Is there a linear relationship between products?
-   Are the NPX ranges in the two products similar?
-   Are there sufficient counts in the Explore HT data?
-   Are the distributions between products the same shape?

An overview of these criteria is visualized below.
```{r, fig.cap= fcap, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("../man/figures/assay_bridgeability.png"), error = FALSE)
fcap <- "Criteria to determine the bridging recommendation for an assay"
```


Prior to assessment, outlier bridge samples are excluded. A sample is considered an outlier if the NPX value is more than 3 times the interquartile range above or below the median on either platform. 

After assessment, an assay is considered bridgeable if it meets the first three criteria. The fourth criteria determines which normalization method is recommended for bridging. If all four criteria are met than the recommended method is normalization using the median of paired differences. If only the first three criteria are met then quantile-quantile normalization is recommended. If any of the first three criteria are not met than bridging is not recommended for that assay. Note that bridgeable assays
will differ between projects based on the expression of bridge samples
in the studies.

#### Assessing linearity across products

To determine if there is a linear relationship between products for an assay, the linear coefficient of determination is calculated using Pearson correlation. In this correlation counts below 10 are excluded due to lack of signal. The R^2 value is calculated and an assay is considered to have a linear relationship across products if the R^2 value is above the cutoff. The default cutoff is set to R^2 > 0.8.

#### Assessing similarity of NPX ranges

To determine if the NPX ranges are similar across products, the difference in NPX values from the 10% to 90% quantile is calculated for each platform, excluding data points with counts less than 10. If the difference in range between platforms is greater than the cutoff than the ranges are not considered similar across platforms. By default, the cutoff is a difference of less than 1 NPX between platforms.

#### Assessing if there are sufficient counts.

To determine if there are sufficient counts in an assay for bridging, the median number of counts from Explore HT is calculated, excluding counts less than 10. If the median number of counts is less than the cutoff than the assay does not have sufficient counts to be used for bridging. The default cutoff is a median of greater than 150 counts.

#### Assessing similarity of NPX distribution across products

If the three criteria outlined above are met than the assay is considered bridgeable. Otherwise, bridging is not recommended for that assay. If an assay is bridgeable the similarity of the NPX distribution is used to determine which method is recommended for bridging. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, or KS test, is used to assess the similarity of two distributions by calculating the distances between the NPX distributions for each product. If the distance is above the cutoff than quantile-quantile normalization is recommended. If the distance is less than the cutoff than normalization using the median of paired differences is recommended. By default this cutoff difference is set to 0.2.

### Normalization using the median of paired differences

If it is expected that both the kind of distribution and the equal variance per test between runs are the same, then the normalization using the median of paired differences will be preferred. The normalization using the median of paired differences based on the bridge samples is performed in the following steps:

  1. For each assay and the Explore 3072 project, calculate the pairwise difference for each of the overlapping samples with the Explore HT project.
  
  2. Estimate the normalization factor of each assay by finding the median of the pairwise differences.
  
  3: Use the assay-specific normalization factor for each assay to normalize each data point from Explore 3072 to Explore HT.

### Quantile-Quantile normalization

Since Explore HT and Explore 3072 are two distinct products and the assays differ considerably between products, some of the assays exist in corresponding but distinct NPX spaces. For those assays, a Quantile-Quantile normalization will be favored. The normalization using the Quantile-Quantile Normalization based on the bridge samples is performed in the following steps:

  1. For each assay of Explore 3072, calculate the empirical distribution function.
  
  2. Map the empirical distribution function from Explore 3072 to the Explore HT space using the quantiles.
  
  3. Construct a spline regression model using the sorted Explore 3072 data and the mapped Explore 3072 data along with the anchor points of the spline function.
  
  4. Use the spline regression model to predict all the data points from Explore 3072 to Explore HT.

```

## FAQs

### Correlation Assays

Both the Explore 3072 and Explore HT platforms contain correlation assays in 
their biomarker portfolios. In Explore 3072, these present as overlapping assays 
across panels. In Explore HT, these are overlapping assays across blocks. 
The correlation assays are included for QC purposes and allow users to evaluate 
data performance across panels in Explore 3072 and across blocks in Explore HT. 

Within each platform, the correlation assays contain unique OlinkID values for each 
of their corresponding panels and blocks in Explore 3072 and Explore HT, 
respectively. It should be noted that the correlation assays themselves differ
between each platform. For more information on overlapping assays, you can 
access the [Olink FAQ page](https://olink.com/knowledge/faq). 

Explore 3072 to Explore HT bridging generates and returns adjusted values for all 
data points corresponding to each of the Explore 3072 correlation assays. In other
words, each instance of an overlapping assay will contain an adjusted value in its
respective Explore 3072 panel *For consistency in reference values, only the Block 
5 data points from Explore HT's correlation assays are used in the Explore 3072 to
Explore HT bridging process. For downstream analysis, it is recommended to include 
the data from all instances of the correlation assays, barring any clear outliers.*
